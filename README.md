# lustre_clients
templates for deploying Lustre clients for more than 40 machines

Based on the templates by Arsen Vladimirskiy from this repository:
https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/intel-lustre-clients-on-centos 

Removed the Availability Set because of the 100 VM limit

Added multiple Storage Account creation because of the 40 VM limit.
